u-boot-imx
==========

This repository is used to track U-Boot for our i.MX6 based boards:

* [BD-SL-i.MX6 (SABRE Lite)][sabrelite]
* [Nitrogen6X][nitrogen6x]
* [Nitrogen6X SOM][nitrogen6x-som]
* [Nitrogen6X SOM v2][nitrogen6x-somv2]
* [Nitrogen6 Lite][nitrogen6-lite]
* [Nitrogen6 MAX][nitrogen6-max]
* [Nitrogen6 VM][nitrogen6-vm]
* [Nitrogen6 SoloX][nitrogen6-sx]
* [Nitrogen7][nitrogen7]

It is based on the main-line upstream at [http://git.denx.de][denx].

Latest stable branch is:

* [boundary-v2016.03](https://github.com/zyt510998645/u-boot-imx6/tree/boundary-v2016.03): Based on v2016.03.

[Other branches](http://github.com/boundarydevices/u-boot-imx6/branches) are used for work in progress, sharing experimental code and to
preserve the history for customers who base their efforts on ours.
